# Lecture 03: Embeddings and PyTorch for LLMs

**Date:** Wednesday, September 23, 2026

**Central question:** How do discrete tokens become trainable representations?

The core deck has **60 slides**, including **exactly ten classical-bridge
slides (11–20)**. Students follow one computation from token
IDs to next-token loss, train a small model, and reason about its parameters
and memory. The classical bridge explains context counts, PPMI, SVD/GloVe,
CBOW/skip-gram, one checked gradient, fastText, and the limits of static-vector
similarity. It connects these ideas to current token tables and contextual
states. Longer derivations and classification history remain in
[optional reading](classical-reading.md), with links to the complete Spring
lecture. The instructor requested this bounded expansion on September 20.

## Learning objectives

By the end, students can:

- Trace lookup, context states, output logits, shifted targets, and loss shapes.
- Run a PyTorch training step and inspect gradient pathways.
- Explain what the classical objectives preserve and what contextual states add.
- Evaluate a held-out coverage probe without modifying parameters or gradients.
- Distinguish token embeddings, contextual states, and retrieval vectors.
- Explain weight tying and account for parameter, gradient, and optimizer storage.
- Inspect configuration and tokenizer metadata without downloading weights.

The running `TinyLM` is explicitly a **bigram model with a vector bottleneck**.
It does not use the full prefix. A feedforward context network is introduced
next week; Transformer architecture comes later in the course.

## Three-period sequence

Times include the exercises. Breaks are outside the 135 teaching minutes.

| Period | Minutes | Slides | Teaching and activity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0–8 | 1–6 | Visual bigram review (3 min) and neural bridge (1 min); introduce shapes and representation types |
| 1 | 8–18 | 7–10 | Trainable lookup, one-hot equivalence, dtype and device; **E01, 4 min** |
| 1 | 18–43 | 11–20 | Ten-slide classical bridge listed below; **E02, 4 min**, followed immediately by autograd |
| 1 | 43–45 | 21 | Contrast a static lookup with a context-dependent state |
| 2 | 0–10 | 22–25 | Shift sequences into next-token pairs; **E03, 4 min** |
| 2 | 10–24 | 26–34 | Bigram limitation, output projection, raw-logit cross-entropy, safe reshaping, uniform baseline, numerical stability |
| 2 | 24–38 | 35–38 | Inspect gradients, run SGD, and read the toy loss curve; **E04, 6 min** |
| 2 | 38–45 | 39–41 | Run the held-out coverage probe; distinguish evaluation mode, gradient recording, fitting, and generalization |
| 3 | 0–9 | 42–45 | Weight tying and its gradient pathways; **E05, 4 min** |
| 3 | 9–26 | 46–55 | Unique parameters, pinned Qwen configurations, tokenizer rows, fp32 training-memory ledger, measured optimizer state, projection FLOPs; **E06, 4 min** |
| 3 | 26–30 | 56–60 | Retrieval preview, optional student contribution, exit questions; leave reading slides for reference |
| 3 | 30–45 | — | **Quiz 1**, 15 minutes, as published on the course website |

Quiz content and grading remain in the private instructor repository. E01–E06
and P01–P03 are **ungraded practices** and use no Assignment A1 data or code.
The same activities and expectations apply to all students.

## The ten-slide classical bridge

Keep this block to about 25 minutes including E02. Explain the transferable
idea on each slide; optional reading supplies the full derivations. Static
embeddings remain useful baselines and components, while the core course goal
is to understand token lookup inside a trainable language model.

| Slide | Topic | Connection carried forward |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 11 | Distributional hypothesis and toy counts | Learn from context statistics |
| 12 | PMI and PPMI | Compare association with a frequency-aware baseline |
| 13 | Truncated SVD and GloVe | Compression and the choice of training objective |
| 14 | CBOW versus skip-gram | Specify what predicts what; distinguish causal training |
| 15 | Center and context tables | Parameters can serve different input/output roles |
| 16 | Negative sampling | Distinguish pair discrimination from normalized next-token likelihood |
| 17 | E02: one gradient | Connect a loss to a parameter update |
| 18 | The same gradient with autograd | Verify the hand calculation with executable evidence |
| 19 | fastText and character n-grams | Compare subword composition with an LLM tokenizer |
| 20 | Similarity and analogy limitations | Inspect vectors without mistaking geometry for an LM evaluation |

The following contextual-state slide closes the bridge into modern LMs; it
belongs to the 50 other slides. No Naive Bayes/LR survey, full word2vec backward
derivation, or catalog of benchmark scores is restored to the classroom deck.

## Opening visual review

Use slides 3–4 for a **four-minute recap within the existing opening eight
minutes**. Slide 3 reuses Lecture 02 E01's three sentences. Recall tokens and
arbitrary IDs, trace the three `I` contexts, accumulate `am:2, do:1`, normalize
to `2/3, 1/3`, and draw one next token. The count trace changes the axis units
explicitly; sampling becomes available only for the complete distribution.
`Sam` and `BOS` provide optional second examples. No pair crosses a sentence
boundary; BOS is input-only and EOS terminates a sequence. Reset restores the
complete `I` distribution, which also serves as the PDF example.

Ask students to predict before each click; this is an oral retrieval prompt,
not another timed exercise. Slide 4 then explains the change from count
estimates to trainable lookup and output scores. **TinyLM remains a bigram:**
an embedding alone does not extend its context. The full-prefix context
network is taught later. The deck remains 60 slides, with the classical block
still at slides 11–20 and the existing quiz time intact.

## Notebook correspondence

### Visual explanations and controls

The deck still has 60 slides and the same timing. Seven original diagrams
explain token-to-loss flow (4), CBOW/skip-gram direction (14), contextual states
(21), shifted targets (23), output projection (29), gradient paths (35), and
weight tying (43). Concise explanations or equations remain with each diagram.
Slide 12 shows the toy counts and PPMI side by side, with numerical cell labels.

On slide 7, select IDs 1 and 5, repeat ID 5, then reset. The values match E01;
this takes about one minute within the existing lookup explanation. On slide
51, double the row count, double the width, and reset the fp32 memory bars.
This takes about one minute within the existing resource segment. These
replace part of the spoken explanation and add no timed exercise. Both
controls work with mouse or keyboard, load local assets, and show their
initial examples in the PDF. Use the notebook for the actual training run.

### Exercises

The notebook runs on a CPU with the core `uv sync` environment and makes no
network requests. Predict the result before running each cell. There are
26 minutes of timed pair practice within the schedule above.

| ID | Slide ID | Expected response or computation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E01 | `exercise-01` | Table `(10,4)`, IDs `(2,3)`, lookup `(2,3,4)`, one-hot `(2,3,10)`; product equals lookup; integer IDs and floating-point weights |
| Bridge demo | `count-to-ppmi`, `count-to-dense` | Invented counts total 35; PMI(tea, drink) is 0.4150 bits; truncated SVD produces a `(3,2)` word table |
| E02 | `exercise-02`, `autograd` | Positive-context gradient `(-0.2689,-0.1345)`; full loss 1.2873; autograd agrees with the hand calculation |
| E03 | `exercise-03`, `reshape-batch` | Last targets 5 and 9; embeddings `(2,4,4)`, logits `(2,4,10)`; eight predictions; zero-logit loss `log(10)`; reshape preserves label order |
| E04 | `exercise-04`, `training-curve`, `evaluation-step` | Run 200 SGD updates on eight compatible pairs; final loss below 0.1; evaluate unseen input IDs 0 and 9 without an update |
| E05 | `exercise-05`, `tied-gradient` | Untied input gradients only in selected rows; tied example has gradients in all ten rows; shared gradient equals the sum of the two separate contributions |
| E06 | `exercise-06`, `training-memory`, `inspect-training-state`, `projection-work` | 16,384,000 parameters per exercise table; 31.25 MiB in bf16; 250 MiB fp32 Adam/gradient/parameter subtotal; inspect actual small-model state; toy projection is about 640 forward FLOPs |
| P01 | optional | PPMI from the published word–context counts; information/data is about 0.0944 bits |
| P02 | optional | Train skip-gram on templates and inspect neighbors/analogies; these are toy results |
| P03 | optional | Check a model-table row using pinned configuration/tokenizer metadata and cross-review another pair's evidence |

Students with an older working notebook should rename it before clicking the
Notebook link again. The launcher intentionally preserves their existing
work. It copies the supplied assets into a fresh working notebook directory.

## CS336 connections and scope

[CS336 Lecture 2](https://github.com/stanford-cs336/lectures/blob/main/lecture_02.py)
is the closest match: tensors, memory accounting, gradients, and the training
loop. This lecture introduces shape/dtype/device contracts, non-contiguous
target slices, unique parameter counts, and the size of materialized logits.
Students see an explicit training-memory ledger and inspect initialized Adam
state. A worked dense-projection example distinguishes stored parameters from
repeated computation. Detailed roofline analysis, GPU kernels and distributed
execution remain for later weeks.

We retain sigmoid/softmax and cross-entropy as prerequisites. We do not repeat
the complete Naive Bayes/logistic-regression sequence. Full word2vec gradient
walkthroughs, extended PPMI arithmetic, analogy benchmarks, and document
embedding history are optional. SVD, GloVe, CBOW, and fastText receive bounded
coverage in the ten-slide bridge. TF-IDF returns with retrieval. A short retrieval
preview explains why a document vector differs from a token-table row.

## Mapping from the first draft in PR #157

This supersedes the first-version requirement to reproduce every Spring slide
unchanged. The instructor requested compression and a stronger connection to
modern LMs and CS336 after reviewing that draft.

| First-draft slides | Revised treatment |
| --- | --- |
| 3–32: classification | Logits, softmax and cross-entropy integrated into slides 29–34; other background in optional reading |
| 34–57: meaning and counts | Lookup in slides 6–10; toy counts, PPMI, and compression in 11–13; richer count exercise remains P01 |
| 59–100: word2vec | Slides 14–18, one example and immediate autograd; full diagrams linked from optional reading |
| 101–122: evaluation and static methods | SVD/GloVe in 13, fastText in 19, similarity limits in 20; extended reading and P02 |
| 124–127: retrieval models | Slides 6, 21 and 56 distinguish lookup, contextual states and retrieval representations |
| 129–136: PyTorch | Expanded across the lecture, including shifted targets, training and resource accounting |
| Old E02 | Remains E02; only one gradient is required by hand |
| Old E03 | Lookup becomes E01; loss becomes E03; tied-gradient comparison is new E05 |
| Old E04 | Becomes E06, with pinned Qwen3-0.6B and Qwen3-8B evidence |
| Old P01–P02 | Combined into optional P02; old P03 training loop becomes core E04 |

## Technical points to emphasize

- Uniform logits give loss exactly `log(V)`; arbitrary random initialization
  need not. Use the deliberately zero output table for the controlled check.
- Use `F.logsigmoid` for skip-gram and raw logits with `F.cross_entropy` for
  next-token training. The notebook demonstrates float32 cancellation.
- Untied lookup and tied input/output weights have different gradient paths.
  The gradient experiment keeps forward values identical to isolate tying.
- The tiny-batch check requires labels compatible with the model's context and
  enough capacity. Successful fitting does not establish generalization.
- The two held-out pairs are selected coverage probes for unseen input IDs,
  not representative corpus evaluation. `eval()` and `no_grad()` serve
  different purposes; neither takes an optimizer step.
- Distinguish tokenizer entries, maximum token ID, and allocated table rows.
  Use the latter for parameter counts. Do not count added-token IDs twice.
- The fp32 ledger explicitly includes parameters, gradients and two Adam moment
  tensors, but excludes activations, scalar counters and temporary buffers.
  Measured tensor payload is not allocator or peak device-memory usage.
  Logit storage is an illustrative materialization cost.

## Sources and reproducibility

Sources are in the slide notes, notebook, optional reading and
[asset provenance](assets/README.md). The selected model metadata records
immutable revisions and SHA-256 hashes; no weight files are stored.
`tests/test_lecture_03.py` executes every notebook code cell without network
access, checks the mathematical examples and teaching-figure data, and tests
that the asset lookup works from a copied notebook directory.

The complete model timeline belongs to [issue #154](https://github.com/baojian/llm-26-fall/issues/154)
as a separate document. P03 invites one verified contribution at a time,
with a combined **Sources and Notes** column and peer checking.
