# Lecture 03 media

The PNG images are copied from the instructor's
[Spring 2026 Lecture 03](https://baojian.github.io/llm-26/slides/lecture-03-slides/)
(`slides/lecture-03-slides/media/` in the `baojian/llm-26` repository). The
seven `word2vec-*.png` images were downscaled from about 3460 to 2400 pixels
wide so the lecture folder stays small (6.2 MB to 4.4 MB); the content is
unchanged. The other images are byte-identical copies.

| `models-text-classification.png` | Four classifier families in a two-by-two grid: Naive Bayes (Venn diagram), logistic regression (sigmoid curve), support vector machines (margin), and neural networks (layer diagram). Spring slide image; the Spring deck gives no source for the four pictures. |
| `word2vec-1.png`, `word2vec-2.png` | Skip-gram forward propagation of the loss, in two steps. Screenshots of the word2vec walkthrough by Eric Kim, [aegis4048.github.io](https://aegis4048.github.io/), credited on the Spring reference slide. |
| `word2vec-3.png` to `word2vec-7.png` | Backward propagation of the gradients through the output and input tables, in five steps. Same source. |
| `tensorflow-embedding.png` | Screenshot of the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/) with nearest neighbours of a query word. |
| `embedding-semantic-change.png` | Semantic change of *gay*, *broadcast*, and *awful* over time. Figure from Hamilton, Leskovec, and Jurafsky (2016), [Diachronic Word Embeddings Reveal Statistical Laws of Semantic Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09096). |
| `embedding-paragraph-vector.png` | Paragraph vector framework. Figure from Le and Mikolov (2014), [Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/le14.html). |

The PNGs support the optional [classical reading](../classical-reading.md);
they are not projected in the revised 60-slide core deck. The ten-slide
classical bridge uses diagrams, a labeled PPMI heatmap, native tables,
equations, and runnable examples.

## Revised lecture assets

| File | Content and source |
| --- | --- |
| `model-configs.json` | Selected fields from official Qwen3-0.6B and Qwen3-8B configurations, plus unique token-ID counts and maximum IDs from their tokenizer JSON artifacts. Each source has an immutable repository revision, URL, SHA-256 hash, and check date. No model weights or full tokenizer files are included. |
| `tiny-lm-loss.json` | Editable Plotly teaching figure, sampling notebook E04 at updates 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200. Eight toy input–target pairs, vocabulary 10, width 4, CPU float32, seed 0, nonzero input initialization, zero output initialization, untied tables, SGD learning rate 0.5. This illustrates a training loop and is not a benchmark. |
| `counts-ppmi.json` | Editable Plotly panels for the notebook's invented three-by-three counts and computed PPMI. Labels show counts and bits; the two color scales are separate (0–9 counts and 0–2 bits). Values are checked against the executable notebook. |
| `lookup-values.json` | The 10-by-4 E01 embedding initialization, with CPU PyTorch 2.14.0 and `torch.manual_seed(0)`. The browser draws four selected rows and rounds values to two decimals. These are toy teaching values, not trained model weights. |
| `token-to-loss.svg`, `word2vec-directions.svg`, `contextual-states.svg`, `shifted-targets.svg`, `output-projection.svg`, `gradient-paths.svg`, `weight-tying.svg` | Original course diagrams, authored as editable Excalidraw scenes and exported with `@excalidraw/excalidraw` 0.18.1. Every SVG has a matching `.excalidraw` source. They explain the existing notebook computations; factual sources remain in the associated slide notes. |

The two browser controls are implemented in [demo.js](../demo.js), declared in
[lecture.json](../lecture.json). The lookup control starts at ID 5 and returns
the same row on repeated selection. The memory control starts at 32,000 rows
and width 512, then independently doubles either dimension. It uses a fixed
0–500 MiB bar scale and **fp32 throughout**: 4 bytes for parameters, 4 for
gradients, and 8 for Adam's two moments per parameter. It excludes activations,
counters, temporary buffers, and allocator overhead. The initial subtotal is
250 MiB; doubling both dimensions gives 1,000 MiB. These are the selected table
parameters, not a complete LLM memory estimate.

Both controls have a reset action and a visible initial example. PDF export
shows those initial values with the same explanations. There are no remote
runtime dependencies or automatic animations. Excalidraw is needed only to
edit the drawings; the classroom browser uses their local SVG exports.

The notebook reads `model-configs.json` offline; P03 explains how to check the
primary sources separately. Unique tokenizer IDs are the union of
`model.vocab` values and `added_tokens` IDs, so duplicate entries are not
counted twice. Table arithmetic uses `config.vocab_size`, not the tokenizer
entry count. Both tokenizer snapshots have the same SHA-256 hash.

To refresh the teaching curve after intentionally changing E04, run that cell
and use `e04_losses[step]` for the listed steps. Index 0 is the loss before any
update; index 200 is after 200 updates. `tests/test_lecture_03.py` compares the
figure with the executable notebook, allowing small floating-point differences.

The PPMI counts in optional notebook P01 come from Jurafsky and Martin,
*Speech and Language Processing*, [Appendix J](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/J.pdf),
Figure J.2. The main deck's three-word co-occurrence table is invented toy data.
The notebook recomputes its total (35), PMI(tea, drink), and a rank-two SVD of
its PPMI matrix. It does not reuse the published P01 counts for that example.

The E04 held-out pairs 0 → 1 and 9 → 0 are constructed coverage probes, not a
representative evaluation dataset. They do not alter the training curve.
E06's memory demonstration measures the payload of a separate small CPU
model's tensors after one Adam update; no checkpoints or run logs are saved.

## Opening n-gram review

`ngram-review.json` is an editable Plotly figure with the exact three-sentence
toy corpus and output vocabulary from [Lecture 02 E01](../../lecture-02/index.html#/exercise-01)
in `layout.meta`. The initial bars are unsmoothed bigram MLEs after `I`:
`am: 2/3`, `do: 1/3`, and zero for the other eight output tokens. Token IDs
are the zero-based positions in that vocabulary; BOS is an input-only marker.
These IDs are local to the recap, not the later notebook's synthetic IDs.

[ngram-review.js](../ngram-review.js) computes sentence-local pairs, counts,
normalization, sampling, and figure specifications. [demo.js](../demo.js)
connects the context, trace, sampling, and reset buttons. Tracing first shows
raw counts, then explicitly normalizes; the axes label the changing units.
Sampling is one draw from the complete selected conditional distribution,
with EOS labeled as stop. There are no cross-sentence pairs, smoothing, model
weights, remote runtime requests, or autoplay. Print starts from the complete
`I` distribution. `tests/test_ngram_review.mjs` verifies the corpus counts and
sampling boundaries; the slide browser check verifies the controls.
