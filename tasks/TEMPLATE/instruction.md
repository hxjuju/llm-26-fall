# {{TITLE}}

**Lecture:** {{LECTURE}} · **Difficulty:** easy · **Time:** about 45 minutes ·
**Deadline:** Tuesday 23:59

## Goal

REPLACE: One sentence saying what the student will be able to do afterwards.

## What you submit

One file: `submissions/<your-github-username>.py` containing a function

```python
def solve(text: str) -> list[str]:
    ...
```

REPLACE: Describe the input and the output precisely (types, order, edge cases).

## Examples

| Input | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| REPLACE `"..."` | REPLACE `[...]` |
| REPLACE `""` | REPLACE `[]` |

## Before you code: predict, then break it

Your file also contains three things the checker reads:

```python
PREDICTIONS = {  # write these BEFORE writing solve; the checker compares solve to them
    "REPLACE input 1": ["REPLACE what you expect"],
    "REPLACE input 2": ["REPLACE"],
    "REPLACE input 3": ["REPLACE"],
}
MY_CASES = [  # two inputs of your own where a naive solution fails, with the expected output
    ("REPLACE", ["REPLACE"]),
    ("REPLACE", ["REPLACE"]),
]
NOTES = """
REPLACE: answer in 3–5 sentences: REPLACE the why-question for this task.
"""
```

The three prediction inputs are: REPLACE `"..."`, REPLACE `"..."`, REPLACE `"..."`.

## How it is checked

`tests/test_task.py` calls your `solve` on the examples above and on a few
similar cases, checks that `solve` agrees with your `PREDICTIONS`, that
`MY_CASES` are new and pass, and that `NOTES` is not empty. Run it yourself
before opening the PR:

```sh
uv run python scripts/tasks.py check tasks/{{LECTURE}}/{{SLUG}} <username>
```

Your PR also runs these public checks automatically. Open **Checks → Public
task feedback** for the milestone report and failed cases; push to the same
branch to try again. Passing checks does not trigger a merge.

## Rules

- Standard library only unless the instruction says otherwise.
- Use your own words and code; discussing the approach with classmates is fine.
- PR title `{{LECTURE}}/{{SLUG}}: <username>`, body `Related to #<issue>`.
- Open your PR by the deadline; solutions merge in one batch per task only
  after the deadline. Public PRs and forks remain visible before merging.

## Why this matters

REPLACE: One or two sentences linking the task to the lecture.
